  "I went to Southeast Asia for walking tour with my friends when I was an exchange student of University of Malaysia. "
    "I went to Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam for three weeks. My favorite city among them is Chiang Mai in Thailand. "
    "The city was very calm and restfulness. There were few people and cars in the road, so it was very quiet. I stayed at Chiang Mai for three days. "
    "The day, I just spent my free time for having a branch at the cafe and walking around the town in the city. "
    "There were some Westerner, but I could not see any Korean, also Asian. There were many vehicles called 'toktok' so I took the vehicles many times during the trip. "
    "Second day, I climbed a mountain and slept in a hut in the mountain. It was very cold at night so my friends and I couldn't sleep well. "
    "The last day of the trip in Chiang Mai I did rafting in the forest. There were six people in the boat. The boat was swept away very fast, so it was exciting. "
    "The last city which I visited during the trip was Hanoi in Vietnam. Actually I went to Hanoi on January. "
    "At that time it was quite cold weather in the city. But my friends and I thought it was hot so we could not bring any winter clothes. "
    "When we went to the city, there were people with winter clothes, boots and earmuffs. We wanted to buy some winter clothes, but we didn't have much money. "
    "We couldn't see the night view and couldn't have a dinner at the nice restaurant. Actually we planned to go Ha Long Bay but we couldn't go there. "
    "We should come back to the hotel before dark. So if I have a free time in the future, I hope to go to Hanoi again to enjoy food and beautiful place completely. "
    "Also I want to go on a trip in Bali. Actually when I was touring around Southeast Asia, I didn't have enough time and money so I couldn't go to Bali. "
    "Someday I will go to the city to enjoy my holiday."
