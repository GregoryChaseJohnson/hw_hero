 "I went to Southeast Asia for a walking tour with my friends when I was an exchange student at the University of Malaysia. "
    "I visited Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam for three weeks. My favorite city among them is Chiang Mai in Thailand. "
    "The city was very calm and restful. There were few people and cars on the road, so it was very quiet. I stayed in Chiang Mai for three days. "
    "During the day, I spent my free time having brunch at a caf√© and walking around the town. "
    "There were some Westerners, but I could not see any Koreans or other Asians. There were many vehicles called 'tuk-tuks,' so I took them many times during the trip. "
    "On the second day, I climbed a mountain and slept in a hut on the mountain. It was very cold at night, so my friends and I couldn't sleep well. "
    "On the last day of the trip in Chiang Mai, I went rafting in the forest. There were six people in the boat. The boat was swept away very quickly, so it was exciting. "
    "The last city I visited during the trip was Hanoi in Vietnam. Actually, I went to Hanoi in January. "
    "At that time, the weather in the city was quite cold. However, my friends and I thought it would be hot, so we did not bring any winter clothes. "
    "When we arrived in the city, we saw people wearing winter clothes, boots, and earmuffs. We wanted to buy some winter clothes, but we didn't have much money. "
    "We couldn't see the night view and couldn't have dinner at a nice restaurant. We had actually planned to go to Ha Long Bay, but we couldn't make it. "
    "We had to return to the hotel before dark. So, if I have free time in the future, I hope to go to Hanoi again to fully enjoy the food and beautiful places. "
    "I also want to go on a trip to Bali. When I was touring around Southeast Asia, I didn't have enough time or money, so I couldn't go to Bali. "
    "Someday, I will go to the city to enjoy my holiday."
