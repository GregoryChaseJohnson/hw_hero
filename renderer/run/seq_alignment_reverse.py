      What is your favorite subject in your school? If I ask this to my friends most of them says that it is P.E class. P.E class is the only time for students to exercise and play around during school time. It can be the best time for most of the students, but however, there are some students which don't want to exercise during P.E time. They don't want to move their body or have physical disadvantages. However, many schools are still requiring P.E and sports time. So, should sports should be required in school? I believe that it should be not required, but should be optional.

First, we should respect students' opinions. Some students want sports time. But some does not. We can't require even one side's opinion. In my school, we have selected-subject time. We can choose the class which I wants and we could also choose what sports class I could attend. And to respect each students our school made the board game class. And we could be able to just relax or play board games during sports time.

Second, it can make dark history to some students. If we play any sports, sometimes we make mistakes. But most of the students criticize the student which made a mistake. And some even bullies. When I was in middle school first grade, I was playing soccer with my classmates. I was playing as goalkeeper. But I made a mistake, and we lose one goal.
