As the world keeps affected by K-pop, some people are concerned about K-pop music's bad influence because it can have the bad effect. But, for my opinion, I strongly believe that K-pop has more positive effect than harm on the youth.

Firstly, it can inspire confidence and hope. In my life, I'm having hard time due to the homework and school test. But, I sometimes get rested by hearing K-pop music and getting hope by it. Also, during COVID-19 pandemic, I was having hard time by its regulation. But when BTS's song named 'Permission to Dance', I can feel the hope to end the pandemic.

Secondly, it can make the whole culture more interest to youths. In my school, how many girl classmates gather and hang out to talk about their favorite K-pop singer or songs. Also, they collect their money or go to other place merchandise product of singer. This can trigger youths to make more friends and making them to be more socialized, which is important to later on the work.

Third and lastly, it can make Korean youth to think again about their traditional culture and proud of. Like recent I heard many about the Pusion.

But in my opinion, I strongly believe that K-pop has a more positive impact than harm on youth.

But when I heard BTS's song "Permission to Dance," I felt hopeful about the end of the pandemic.

Secondly, it can make the whole culture more interesting to young people. In my school, many of my female classmates gather and hang out to talk about their favorite K-pop singers or songs. They also save up their money to buy merchandise from their favorite artists. This can encourage young people to make more friends and become more social, which is important for their future careers.
