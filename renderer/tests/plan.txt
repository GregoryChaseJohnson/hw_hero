Summary of the Plan
Tokenization

Parse the text into tokens with associated colors (red, green, or normal).
Each token represents a character and its formatting.
Block Creation

Identify and group tokens into blocks:
Replace Blocks: Red token followed by green tokens until a non-green token appears.
Insert Blocks: Contiguous green tokens until a non-green token appears.
Delete Blocks: Contiguous red tokens until a non-red token appears.
Normal Blocks: Remaining text, divided into:
Leave-In Text: Contiguous normal text > 8 characters.
Ride-Along Text: Contiguous normal text â‰¤ 8 characters.
Gather Metadata

For each block:
Replace Blocks:
Store green text as short_correction and long_correction (add ride-along text if applicable).
Define anchor_point (first red character), red_end, and lower_measure.
Insert Blocks:
Store green text as short_correction and long_correction.
Define anchor_point (first green character) and lower_measure.
Render Phase

Place corrections above the original text:
If no ride-along text: Insert short_correction above anchor_point unless previous corrections overrun.
If ride-along text exists: Calculate upper_measure and compare to lower_measure to decide placement.
Adjust positions dynamically to avoid overlaps or gaps.
Final Output

Original sentence with corrections removed.
A new line with corrections inserted at the calculated positions.
