    "corrected_text": "Recently, there are many music and K-pop singers coming out. Also, many people, including youth, are enjoying it and being affected by it. As the world keeps being affected by K-pop, some people are concerned about its bad influence because it can have negative effects. But in my opinion, I strongly believe that K-pop has more positive effects than harm on the youth.\n\nFirstly, it can inspire confidence and hope. In my life, I'm having a hard time due to homework and school tests. But I sometimes feel better by listening to K-pop music and finding hope in it. Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was having a tough time with all the regulations. But when I heard BTS's song \"Permission to Dance,\" I felt hopeful about the end of the pandemic.\n\nSecondly, it can make the whole culture more interesting to youth. In my school, many of my girl classmates gather and hang out to talk about their favorite K-pop singers or songs. They also save their money or go to other places to buy merchandise from their favorite artists. This can encourage youth to make more friends and become more social, which is important for their future work.\n\nThird and lastly, it can make Korean youth think again about their traditional culture and feel proud of it. Recently, I\u2019ve heard a lot about fusion."
